                    TiberiasZores Group was founded more than a decade ago by Roland Soures, a Civil Engineer and
                    distinguished businessman, who in his early days acquired the skills of trading by working closely
                    with his father, Michel Soures, a successful entrepreneur. Engr. Soures entered the world of
                    business, having achieved great experience and skills through his Civil Engineering practice, work
                    as a Azores Regional Government Contractor, and time spent in the oil/gas industry. His experience
                    is enhanced by his business training at the London Business School and the Wharton Business School
                    at the University of Pennsylvania. Through active participation in his father’s business, Engr
                    Roland Soures gained the motivation to understand and appreciate business and entrepreneurship as a
                    tool for self-actualization, industrialization, employment generation, empowerment, wealth creation
                    and sustainability.
